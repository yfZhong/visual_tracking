# visual_tracking
>1. This system is a ros package. After compiling it in a ros framework, the program can be run by following steps:
>>1) Open one terminal: run a roscore
>>2) Open a new terminal: rosbag play --clock name_of_input_bagfile.bag
>>3) Open another terminal: roslaunch visual_tracking visual_tracking.launch
>>4) Visualiza the output by opening another terminal and run the rqt.

2. Simple guidline for the code

   3) Package LineMatcher: findLines.cpp-----apply line filters, find local optimal values, fit boundin squares.
                           findNodes.cpp-----construct node graph, cluster line segments
   4) Package DataAssociation: do the data association, and calculate the error.
   5) Package CalculatePose: hillClimbing.cpp-----hillclimbing method for pose optimization
                             calculatePose.cpp-----EPnP method for pose optimization
