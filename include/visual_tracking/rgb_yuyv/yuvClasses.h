* @file  soccer_vision/src/yuvClasses.h
* @brief Implements the Color classification and Image-subsampling of the Nimbro-OP Soccer package.
* 
* \b Color \b classification
* 
* The classification of pixels is done individually, every pixel will be checked in the look up tables to 
* determine to which class it belongs to (i.e.: Black, White, Green, Orange, Yellow, No Class).
* 
*  \image html soccer_vision/ColorClassesSmall.png Color classification diagram
* 
* A YUV look up table is composed of the following data:
* 
* 1) Y range [minY,maxY]
* 
* 2) UV image, which is a 255x255 image that stores true/false  values 
*    to denote the coordinates in the color space that belong or not to an specific color class.
*
* \image html soccer_vision/LUTdefinition2.png Y range and UV Look up table
*  
* For a pixel to belong to a specific color class, its Y value has to be within a certain range and the (U,V) coordinate has to be set to true
* in the look up table.
* 
* There are 5 color classes in the NimbRo-OP vision code, naturally, each one has an id-number that identifies: 
* * [0] Black 
* * [1] White
* * [2] Green (field) 
* * [3] Orange (ball)
* * [4] Yellow (goals)
*
* The following image is an exaple of the color classification procedure, where every gray scale tone represents a color class.
* 
* \image html soccer_vision/colorClassification.png Soccer field after color classification
* 
* \b Image-subsampling
* 
* 
* An other important function of this class is to carry out image sub-sampling, which is called after the color 
* classification of each YUV frame. As aforedmentioned, the original size of an image is 800x600 with 
* ca. 25 fps.  However, all the detections are done using images 4 times smaller than the original 
* one (size 200x150) to speed up the detection process.  Furthermore, there are 5 binary images
* that contain only the pixels that correspond to its specific class.
*
* 
* These sub-images are created using a 4x4 window (16 pixels) from the original image that maps into 
* 1 pixel of the the sub-image. The following image shows the top-left (4x4 pixel) part of an image 
* which is being mapped into the different color classes. 
* 
* \image html soccer_vision/subsampling.png Subsampling the classified image
* 
* In the above example we can the see general idea of the method: the original image
* has 4 (4x4 pixel) windows, each one corresponds to 1 pixel of the subimage. 
* 
* The approach to fill out the sub images is as follows:
* 
* For all the pixels in the  4x4 windows of the original image:
*    - Count the incidences of each color class
*    - Put the total count in the corresponding color class subimage
* 
* It should be noted that the maximum number of incidences is 16, meaning that  the analized 
* window only had pixels of one color class.
* 
* 
* The following set of images show the result of the color classification and the image subsampling.
* 
* <table border="0">
* <tr>
